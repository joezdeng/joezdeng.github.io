		<h2>Startup Institute Hack Day.</h2>
		<article class="portFull">
			<div class="portText">
				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>Links is the product of research and prototyping completed during the Startup Institute Hack Day over a 24-hour period. The prompt was to create a good solution for finding roommates online by connecting based on aspects that matter to human beings, targeting 18-35-year-old urban-dwellers. Interviews revealed that the primary motivation for seeking out roommates was to reduce rent costs. This often co-occurred with relocation due to new employment or educational pursuits.</p>
				<p>Every interviewee indicated that they turned or would have had to turn to technology for the search only after exhausting all personal leads. However, those that used technology found the disparity between personal leads and anonymous online listings to be dismal. My solution sits as an intermediate between these two options.</p>
				<h3>Interviews</h3>
				<p>Several people in their early-to-mid-twenties were interviewed about how they found their current and past roommates and any difficulties they experienced.</p>
				<p>Most were able to find their roommates by asking friends and acquaintances. It was “super quick to find roommates from people [they] liked.” At the very least, they met with the potential roommates at least once to evaluate them.</p>
				<p>The search for roommates often accompanied the search for housing, but most had decided on the roommates before even starting the housing search. Some noted that it was easier this way because everyone could be on the same page in terms of location, price, type of place, etc.</p>
				<p>Those who had to resort to Craigslist found an unwelcoming and frustrating service but had no other options. One user contacted 30-40 listings and only received two valid responses with several being expired.</p>
				<p>Every user indicated a desire for cleanliness, but this in effect amounted to varying levels for the threshold of cleanliness.</p>

			<div class="portText">
				<h3>Customer Journey Map</h3>
				<p>This customer journey map helps to visualize the actions/situations (yellow) and feelings/emotions (blue) of an individual searching for roommates as a progression in time. Also marked are the exit points where an individual would skip to the evaluation if a viable roommate were found.</p>

				<h3>Onboarding</h3>
				<p>Because the jump to technology represents a higher level of urgency or frustration, the onboarding process for Links was divided over several screens. This made each understandable in itself and acts to prevent attrition due to being overwhelmed or confused.</p>

				<h3>Interface</h3>
				<p>Based on feedback from the initial prototype and algorithmic considerations for match rate, the Links homescreen lists all potential roommates given the user’s restrictions and allows sorting by distance, cost, and mutual friends.</p>

		<h2>Health Service Forms.</h2>

			<div class="portText-half">
				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>With the redesign of the Northwestern University Student Affairs website, many departments had the task of updating their web content. Among these departments was the university Health Service, which had 12 major forms that were to be revised and standardized.</p>
				<p>The form revisions provided the perfect opportunity to incorporate more current web standards. I optimized these forms for assistive screen reader technology commonly used by low sighted and partial vision users through accessibility best practices and user testing.</p>
				<p>A number of these forms are available online at the <a href="http://www.northwestern.edu/healthservice-evanston/administrative-services/forms/index.html">Northwestern University Evanston Health Services website</a>.</p>
